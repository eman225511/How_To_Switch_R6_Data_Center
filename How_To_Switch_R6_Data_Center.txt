Selecting data centres manually in Rainbow Six Siege (PC)
To find your data centre file:

•  Close your game if it is currently running.
•  Open the File Explorer.
•  Navigate to C:\Users\<User>\Documents\My Games\Rainbow Six - Siege\UbisoftConnectID.
UbisoftConnectID is a long string of letters and numbers unique to your Ubisoft account.
You will see multiple folders if you have played on more than one account.
•  Delete the folders and start the game from your account.
You should now see a single folder for your account containing a default GameSettings.ini file.
•  Right-click the GameSettings.ini file.
•  Choose Open with and select Notepad.
You will see a list of game settings.
•  Scroll to the bottom of the document.
You will see the following:
 
[ONLINE]
;DataCenterHint =>
; default (ping based)
; playfab/australiaeast
; playfab/brazilsouth
; playfab/centralus
; playfab/eastasia
; playfab/eastus
; playfab/japaneast
; playfab/northeurope
; playfab/southafricanorth
; playfab/southcentralus
; playfab/southeastasia
; playfab/uaenorth
; playfab/westeurope
; playfab/westus
;
DataCenterHint=default
 
 
All lines with a semicolon in front are a list of the possible datacentre choices.

The bottom line (DataCenterHint=default) is the selection currently set to default, which means the datacentre will be chosen automatically.
 
To manually select your data centre:
 
•  Change default selection to the datacentre of your choosing.
For example: DataCenterHint=playfab/westeurope for West Europe or DataCenterHint=playfab/centralus for Central US.
•  Save the file, then start the game.
•  While in the game, press F10 on your keyboard or select the gear icon in the top-right corner.
 
Below the options, you will see the currently selected data centre, your ping, and your NAT type.
 
You can change your server again at any time by closing the game and changing the values as instructed above.
